One Year

00:00:01.225 --> 00:00:03.950
The poet Suikou made his way to Tenshukaku

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:07.100
And presented the Kasen's work for the Shogun's perusal

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:11.475
But a page from the works of Aoi no Okina had been torn out

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:14.000
And Suikou was questioned regarding the matter

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.375
Suikou pleaded guilty

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:20.992
He admitted to drinking at the tavern the night before

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.950
And vaguely recalled a mysterious figure approaching while he was intoxicated
