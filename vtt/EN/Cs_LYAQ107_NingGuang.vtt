00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:07.950
They say that when Lady Ningguang ponders important affairs

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:11.375
She retreats to her Jade Chamber

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:15.375
With none but her three closest confidantes in tow

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:20.019
Why brings she these trusted three?

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.814
To sift through sources, dig through documents

00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:25.814
Looking for information

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:30.339
Piece by piece, facts and figures

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.925
Paint a picture on the walls of the chamber...

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.975
But well before the wall is filled

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:39.775
Lady Ningguang's mind is made up

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.545
Having made her call

00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:46.275
She has every last document shredded

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:51.080
And fwoosh! She scatters the shavings out her window

00:00:52.778 --> 00:00:54.725
Ah, look at them!

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:56.733
How they billow in the wind

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.825
Like a sudden swirling blizzard!

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.925
As the fragments fall

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.625
Traces of text

00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:07.750
Flicker before the eyes of the merchants of Liyue

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:10.775
Like ink stains in white snow

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.916
The saying goes:

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:15.475
The rarest treasures in the land

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.550
Are the words brought by the paper snow

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.900
For the words of the Tianquan have the power to move mountains

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.925
And all throughout the land know it
