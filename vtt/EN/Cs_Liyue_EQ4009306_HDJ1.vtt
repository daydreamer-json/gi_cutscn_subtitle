00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:06.225
In times gone by, one quarreled oft with Guizhong concerning mechanical principles

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:09.600
We each had our ideals, and neither would yield

00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:12.875
Under the pretext of a social gathering

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:15.296
One invited the impartial Rex Lapis

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.675
To judge the quality of our creations...

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.950
But Rex Lapis declared

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.875
That Guizhong's Obscuro Vulpes Mechanism was superior

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:30.625
Though one was too proud to acknowledge it, in one's heart, one knew

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.875
That Guizhong was indeed the superior talent in the mechanical arts...

00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:39.600
As for the story between Guizhong and Streetward Rambler

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:41.673
That begins with a certain bell

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:47.975
In Guizhong's opinion, while mechanisms were no substitute for human composers

00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:52.200
They were yet capable of producing simple but fine melodies

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:57.750
But Streetward Rambler believed music to be an expression of the soul

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.975
An emotional enterprise that could never hope to be replicated by machinery

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:08.675
They argued endlessly, until one asked Rex Lapis to intercede

00:01:08.928 --> 00:01:12.900
He confiscated the bell, and designated it for ceremonial use

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.325
Thereafter, one would often find them convening in the mountains

00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:23.450
Discussing music, mechanics, and all the affairs of the mortal world

00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:29.050
But these good times were not to last

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.656
War broke out between the gods, and soon engulfed the Guili Plains

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:39.072
Guizhong was overpowered by the enemy, and fell in battle

00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:47.500
When Streetward Rambler and I arrived at the scene at long last, all that remained among the ruins... was her lifeless body

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:51.936
After this, at Streetward Rambler's request

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.352
Rex Lapis granted her the Cleansing Bell for safekeeping

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.680
To honor our friend's memory

00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:04.672
One made a few finishing touches to her ballistic device...

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:12.200
Many Lantern Rites have passed since then... many greetings and goodbyes

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.050
Upon what do you gaze? The Guili Plains?

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.700
No, it's... everything

00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:39.025
We think of human life as like a lantern that's lit one minute and extinguished the next, but are we adepti so different?

00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:42.700
Perhaps, as dust settles after a storm

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.525
We too must one day return to the world below
