00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.392
In Old Mondstadt transpired the story to be told

00:00:04.096 --> 00:00:07.744
Where a tyrant ruled, I met a boy, not that old

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.800
The lyre he played, and for a song he sought

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.368
But storm-walls blocked blue sky â€” he was sincerely distraught

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:21.950
"I do so wish to see the birds in flight"

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.344
Said he, his strong eyes filling with light

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.800
But his voice was lost in the howling wind's churn

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.792
For the whirlwind takes, and gives naught in return

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:39.104
The true sky, and songs that cageless soar...

00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:42.688
Were they not wishes worth fighting for?

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.825
So the boy turned, extending his hand:

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:50.275
"Let us cast down the tyrant and his walls from this land"

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:53.376
The young boy raised then the flag of revolt

00:00:53.376 --> 00:00:56.350
And I threw myself into freedom's tumult

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.520
Victorious were we who fought to be free

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.680
Gods fell, winds whipped, nations shook violently

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:09.184
In the smoke, a despot met his doom

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.000
And we watched as his great tower fell none too soon

00:01:15.328 --> 00:01:18.784
Mondstadt began anew, the story passed down

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:23.264
And since then never has another worn its crown
