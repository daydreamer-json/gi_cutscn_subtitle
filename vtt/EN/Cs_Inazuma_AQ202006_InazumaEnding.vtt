00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.144
As promised, the Raiden Shogun abolished the Vision Hunt Decree

00:00:07.025 --> 00:00:11.025
Finally, her people's wishes penetrated her locked heart

00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:20.037
Beyond the Plane of Euthymia, she saw what eternity means in the eyes of the world

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:27.250
When one's fervent ambition burns brightly

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.950
The gods will cast their gaze upon you

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.800
Some ambitions

00:00:40.488 --> 00:00:42.525
Have the power to heal wounds

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:45.261
To bring victory

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.569
To inspire hope

00:00:54.372 --> 00:00:55.775
But some ambitions

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:03.780
Outlive their masters, long after the soul ascends

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.851
They remain as they were in the beginning

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:17.211
Burning bright and true

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:21.725
For all eternity
