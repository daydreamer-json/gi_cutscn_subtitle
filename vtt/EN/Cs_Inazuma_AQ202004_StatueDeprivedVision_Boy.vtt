00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:16.875
Dear me

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:18.875
Aren't you cutting it rather close?

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.700
Miko

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.850
This was your doing...?

00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:28.159
Now, now

00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:30.350
Don't forget who taught you

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.525
How to place your consciousness in objects

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.625
Surely you don't think

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:36.832
Your ambition alone

00:00:36.832 --> 00:00:39.725
Is enough to shake Ei's will? Do you?

00:00:41.773 --> 00:00:43.675
Though you alone are here

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:45.850
They too have ambitions

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:48.225
Which they long since entrusted to you

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:54.400
Now then

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.000
Close your eyes

00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:22.642
Abolish the Vision Hunt Decree
