00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:04.992
Long ago, Inazuma had five legendary poets

00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:08.768
People bestowed upon them the title of The Five Kasen

00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:10.368
One Year

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.550
The poet Suikou made his way to Tenshukaku

00:00:13.632 --> 00:00:16.725
And presented the Kasen's work for the Shogun's perusal

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:20.864
But a page from the works of Aoi no Okina had been torn out

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.125
And Suikou was questioned regarding the matter

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.175
Suikou pleaded guilty

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.675
He admitted to drinking at the tavern the night before

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.000
And vaguely recalled a mysterious figure approaching while he was intoxicated

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:42.625
That figure was none other than Aoi no Okina himself

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:46.025
This turn of events had begun with an unnamed individual

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:49.200
Under whose coercion Aoi no Okina was forced

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.025
To take drastic measures to retrieve a page of poetry

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:53.400
He knew nothing

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.825
Of this individual's true intentions 

00:00:56.576 --> 00:00:57.375
All he knew was that

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:00.725
The poem had to do with an old acquaintance, Akahito

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.075
Akahito had once belonged to the Five Kasen

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.250
Each poem he composed, he marked with a scarlet red seal

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:13.125
Hence the "Aka" in his name

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.625
Such a distinguished writer was he

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:18.800
And yet one of the poems he had submitted the previous year

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:20.925
Was found to be plagiarized

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:24.050
Akahito was exiled for his crimes

00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:27.600
And only four of the Five Kasen remained

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.025
Sumizome went over Akahito's poems

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.525
And noticed that the plagiarized poem lacked his seal

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.250
She immersed his poetry in a stream nearby

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.500
And only on the plagiarized poem

00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:44.525
Did the ink run

00:01:45.152 --> 00:01:47.264
Aoi no Okina passed by

00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:49.050
And witnessed Sumizome's doing

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.975
Which he then recorded in a poem

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:58.025
Thus transpired the events of Suikou's poetry submission

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:01.465
And this is where the story comes to an end
