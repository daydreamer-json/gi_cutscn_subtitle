00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.765
Long ago, when plagues ravaged the land

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.351
One doctor made a pledge

00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:11.301
To rid the world of pain and suffering

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:16.970
But even the most ingenious mortal medicine

00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:19.840
Could not stay the tide of disease

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.500
And after working tirelessly for many years

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.094
Even his dearest loved ones fell sick

00:00:27.578 --> 00:00:29.847
And bade their final farewell

00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:35.025
Legends told of an Herblord in Chenyu Vale

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:38.534
Who could cure any illness known to mankind

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:41.732
The doctor sought the Herblord

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:48.553
But found only a white snake, its breathing weak and its power all but spent

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.049
"Sign this contract, and let our lives be joined"

00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:58.145
"Then I will impart to you the secret art of healing"

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.745
"But be warned: This art will harm your own health"

00:01:03.777 --> 00:01:06.199
With means beyond human ken

00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:10.267
The doctor could now reverse the process of death

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:15.607
And yet, the time still came to say goodbye

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:22.475
Only now... the one departing was the doctor, his life force spent

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:27.979
His final act in life was to pass on the contract

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:32.331
To his final patient: his favorite disciple

00:01:33.473 --> 00:01:40.065
The disciple chose to dedicate their life to saving the lives of others...

00:01:41.537 --> 00:01:46.849
And generation upon generation followed in these footsteps

00:01:53.761 --> 00:02:01.405
Since I inherited this contract, I've always respected the path taken by my predecessors

00:02:02.257 --> 00:02:05.862
And followed it myself unquestioningly

00:02:06.942 --> 00:02:08.542
That is, until...

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.563
I tried to use the art to save my own disciple's beloved

00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:17.403
She begged me not to use up my own life force

00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:23.641
She said that this art is a poisoned chalice, an evil and unnatural practice...

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.812
She did not wish to sacrifice one life for the sake of another, when both were lives she treasured

00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:39.858
...Only then did it occur to me: Did I not suffer when my master passed away

00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:45.217
Just as patients' families do at their loved ones' deathbed?

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:49.359
Are not the lives cut short by this contract

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.322
Just as worthy of saving as any patient's?

00:02:55.192 --> 00:03:00.662
What is this contract to us? Medicine, or poison?

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.735
Alas, I no longer have enough time left to find the answer

00:03:08.181 --> 00:03:13.877
I entrust to your care both Changsheng and this final question

00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:20.213
May you find a remedy for this conundrum, which has ailed us so...

00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:25.807
Time and again... No matter how much I try to warn them

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:29.687
Or balance their qi, I can never save them...

00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:33.207
And you? What's your answer?

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.032
...If I abandoned the contract and left you without a host, what would happen?

00:03:38.032 --> 00:03:43.684
Hmm... I suppose I'd spend my final moments taking a nice nap on Mt. Yaojun

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:48.700
Then, I'd be reunited with my old friends, and your predecessors

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.896
Then it's decided

00:03:51.303 --> 00:03:54.183
If there's a life in front of me that deserves to be saved

00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:57.589
Why shouldn't I do everything within my power to save it?

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.776
...*sigh* Once again, it's the same answer

00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:05.775
So be it. Close your eyes

00:04:07.078 --> 00:04:10.610
...Who knows how many more people will take on this contract

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:12.435
None

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.531
This contract... will end with me
