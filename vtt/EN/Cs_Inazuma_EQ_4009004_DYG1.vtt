00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:02.950
It's said that long ago

00:00:02.975 --> 00:00:06.900
A human samurai once stumbled across the Mikawa Flower Festival

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.000
What's a human doing here?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.069
We erected the barrier, didn't we? Ugh, what a pain...

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.125
The youkai at the festival began discussing

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:24.775
How to drive away the human

00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:28.525
When suddenly, they heard a voice

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:35.890
This is our festival, and the point is to have fun!

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:39.425
What difference does it make if a human joins us youkai!?

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:44.275
The speaker appeared to be a prominent figure among the youkai

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.400
And when he spoke, the other youkai fell silent

00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:50.475
You there, young man. Do you drink sake?

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:52.877
...Yes, I do

00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:58.525
Hah! Then join us. We can enjoy tonight's festivities together. Haha!

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:02.825
And so, the youkai and samurai celebrated together

00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:07.550
The two competed in the highlight of the festival: the Akitsu Hazura (Haneasobi)

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.400
Their spectacular game ended in a draw, and a new friendship was forged...

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.500
Haha, I can't believe a human could keep up with me

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.325
Witnessing the dynamic powers of the youkai

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:22.550
Will certainly help hone my swordsmanship

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.258
You're a swordsman!?

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:28.700
Yes, I'm currently traveling the world in search of formidable opponents

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.350
Then let's make a deal

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:33.825
We meet for a duel every ten years, whaddya say?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.123
I look forward to it
