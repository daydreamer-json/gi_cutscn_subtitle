00:00:01.025 --> 00:00:02.525
One stormy night

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.100
A girl found a way to the future in the library

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:12.875
She said to herself:

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.525
I shall create my dream kingdom

00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:19.925
I'll carve mountains and oceans, and erect castles and towns

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.350
Then she spoke to those who shared her dream:

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:26.125
Please be proud of all that is unreal

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.350
For we are greater than this world!

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:37.300
For our magnificent kingdom is a small and forbidden paradise
