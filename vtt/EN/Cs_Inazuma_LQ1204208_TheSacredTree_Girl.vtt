00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.200
The light turned into...

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:09.650
A seed?

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:12.400
The miracle tree that blesses the people

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.800
In this moment new to the world and yet to be known

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:17.500
When to plant it

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.950
Where it shall bloom...

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.900
She who brings it into being must let her heart and dreams decide

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.250
Grant it life

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:26.400
Ei

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:27.625
Is this...

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.400
Is it really...

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:43.575
Eternity extends time into infinity

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.200
Dreams illuminate each moment within

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.750
When both shine in unison

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.175
The Sacred Sakura blooms from the darkness

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:55.725
Finally free from the clutches of the Heavenly Principles

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:56.500
Now

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.325
The nightmare has dissipated

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.625
And reality is made whole

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:04.350
The vision we both yearn for is still further ahead

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.200
My only regret

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.975
Is that I cannot witness Inazuma's future

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.575
Nor can I walk this journey with you

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:18.725
Do you know

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:19.475
Ei

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.550
I am so happy right now

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:24.225
Because my final wish has now come true

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.050
Your polearm once protected me from countless calamities

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:28.925
For this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.175
I've always felt indebted to you

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.850
Though I could never repay you in full

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:36.575
This Sacred Sakura will buy you some time

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:38.675
Until you are ready to awaken

00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:40.325
And embrace the new

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:42.725
What do you think?

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:44.425
Did it do the trick?

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.475
This time

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.375
It really is goodbye

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.500
Ei

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.425
 

00:02:02.425 --> 00:02:03.250
Goodbye

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.550
Makoto
