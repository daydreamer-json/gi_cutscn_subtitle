My dear friend, you must be wondering

00:00:05.847 --> 00:00:08.043
Why I'm leaving you a letter like this

00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:10.750
It's because...

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.200
Hey, Gulab! I'm here. How are you feeling today?

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.367
I gotta tell you, I had an idea for another card last night

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:21.095
Huh? What's that you're writing?

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:24.164
Haha, it's nothing

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:29.882
Okay... Anyway, up for a game?

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:38.203
You don't have to visit every day, you know. You should be focusing on your work at the Akademiya...

00:00:38.753 --> 00:00:42.031
Hey, enough of that, I'll keep visiting until you've fully recovered

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:46.428
Besides, I can't stand most of the folks at the Akademiya anyway!

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.095
Hey, it's your turn

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.025
*coughing*

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.087
Gulab!? Are you okay?

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.999
*cough* Garvipidam, you must understand...

00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:03.508
My Eleazar...

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.817
Hey! Don't talk like that!

00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:08.982
You just need some more rest...

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.012
*sigh*...

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.436
It's because... you won't come to terms with the fact that I don't have long left

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:26.683
Guess what? This game we invented

00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:29.475
Is getting pretty popular here in the hospital

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.299
Really? That's great news!

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:35.595
Yeah. I've even made a device

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.283
To help people find other players nearby

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.487
Here, this one's for you

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.950
This way, you'll be able to keep playing even after I'mâ€”

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.925
Just stop!

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:51.557
You're gonna get better, you hear me? I don't need this thing... I don't want it!

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.550
I imagine the Casket of Tomes I gave you

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.075
Is probably gathering dust in a corner somewhere...

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:06.649
So, this is my last gift to you. I'm sorry that I could only give it to you now

00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:11.041
Do you remember when we first met?

00:02:11.892 --> 00:02:16.088
You were the only one willing to be friends with the kid with Eleazar

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.691
Now it's my turn to help you make some new friends

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:30.089
This way, I'll always be by your side, my friend
