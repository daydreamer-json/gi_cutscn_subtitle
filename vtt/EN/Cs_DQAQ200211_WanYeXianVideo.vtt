00:00:00.975 --> 00:00:02.925
He was once a good friend of mine

00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:06.368
One day, he asked me about a sword art of which he had heard

00:00:06.368 --> 00:00:07.834
The Musou no Hitotachi

00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:09.750
I told him

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.925
It can only be witnessed when "divine punishment" is administered

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.800
It is the pinnacle of the Raiden Shogun's skill

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.500
A symbol of ultimate power

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.250
But he replied: "There must be one who can withstand it"

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.800
"There will always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow"

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:35.875
Then, the Vision Hunt Decree arrived

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:39.800
Peoples' aspirations were stripped away

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.521
As the Raiden Shogun began to construct her ideal of "eternity"

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:48.125
While I was fleeing from place to place

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:51.600
I heard that my friend had challenged the Vision Hunters

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.200
To a duel before the throne

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.833
A solemn yet brutal challenge

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:04.759
The defeated face divine punishment, while the victors gain a second chance

00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:08.845
Perhaps he thought he of all people should make a stand

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.000
Coming face to face with the Musou No Hitotachi

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.448
Was all that he truly desired, after all

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:18.307
When I arrived at Tenshukaku

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:19.633
The duel was over

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:21.660
I heard his sentence of divine punishment

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.675
His severed blade hitting the ground

00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:27.900
Perhaps that was the glory he had yearned to witness

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:32.517
In his last moments

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.025
What expression was on his face?

00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:38.625
Before I knew it

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:41.275
I had stepped forward and snatched the dying Vision

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:43.263
And was running from the scene

00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:46.950
All I knew was that I mustn't let his hope which burned so brightly

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.100
Become buried among the ice-cold statue of a god
