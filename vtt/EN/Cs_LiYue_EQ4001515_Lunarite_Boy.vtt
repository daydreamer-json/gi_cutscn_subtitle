00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:08.753
Marchosius, God of the Stove, born from a spark when stone struck stone

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.018
He was a god with a great love for humanity

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:15.253
And their well-being

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:21.575
Millennia ago, the people sought to expand their city

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.500
They built a dwelling on the plains and called it the Guili Assembly

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.425
The Stove God cared greatly for the people

00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:35.300
Turning himself into minions who went into every home, fostering food and solidarity alike

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.300
Alas, their home was taken by a flood

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:42.450
The waters ravaged the Guili Assembly

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.483
And forced the people back south, to Liyue Harbor

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.025
Though the distance was not far, the journey was plagued by a terrible storm

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.960
For a dozen days the adepti stayed by their side

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.625
During this time, the Stove God cooked an ancient delicacy

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:10.275
Flatbread with a meat sauce to stave off the cold and damp, fit for those on the move

00:01:14.925 --> 00:01:19.475
Centuries later, disaster and plague arose once more

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.625
The Stove God would appear no longer

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:26.308
For he placed all of his power into the land itself

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:28.669
To quell the calamities

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:32.100
His power expended, and his wits greatly reduced

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.575
Thus, his body decreased in size

00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:38.925
By the time he parted ways with us, he wasn't even the height of a human

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:44.925
He told Rex Lapis and I of the dishes that bring joy and of the secrets of the flame

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:46.955
Then went into the mountains

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:50.121
And entered into a long slumber

00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:59.350
The Stove God departed and Guoba was born

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.600
When he awoke, he ate the Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.875
Placed on the offering table by a young lady in yellow

00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:10.000
Though he did not remember the past, he was profoundly moved

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.100
And decided to follow this young lady thereafter

00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:16.300
The Stove God had quietly disappeared

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.722
But the vendors rose early to hawk their wares

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.626
People went out to buy goods, lit their stoves and cooked food

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.851
Just as they had done every day for as long as they could remember

00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:32.925
In Liyue, things have always been this way

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:47.050
Nature provides, the mountains rejoice, we are blessed by heaven's good grace

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.800
Years have gone by, the world has transformed, but our way of life survives

00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:16.050
Fame and fortune, is only a season, it is the moment that we should embrace
