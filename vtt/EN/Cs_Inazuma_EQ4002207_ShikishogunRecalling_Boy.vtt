00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:13.350
Master Kamuna

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.150
Over half our trained samurai are wounded

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.200
And our shikigami losses are far greater than anticipated

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.650
Besides

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:22.175
The outside situation is beginning to stabilize

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.100
Do we really need to keep pursuing this "ultimate attainment"?

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:28.200
Why so apprehensive?

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:31.200
This is all within my expectation

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.900
Harunosuke

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:34.250
Forgive my directness

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:36.075
But she's not coming back

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:41.800
All I ever wanted... was to assist her descendants

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.950
And guard this territory

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.175
Now that our targets no longer exist

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And those needing our protection are finally safe

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.775
Then perhaps our sworn mission

00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:56.874
Has indeed come to an end

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.583
I always believed

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:06.350
That I would stand guard in this place forever

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.140
If time permitted

00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:11.425
I almost fooled myself

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.000
With such a notion

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.500
I hope you never make the same mistake

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:17.825
Don't worry

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:18.650
Harunosuke

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.050
I know everything

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.725
That you've done for Inazuma

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.550
Your efforts need not be judged by others

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:28.050
The same goes for my existence

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:32.150
Bestowing you with intelligence

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.575
That should you know human emotion

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.975
It would seem this was the right decision

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.075
In the end

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:44.275
It is you that have enlightened me

00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:59.725
"Rosy cheeked in the morning"

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.075
"Bleached bones by dusk"

00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:05.525
How so very true

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.825
I have nothing left

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:09.100
To keep me

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.450
Shiki Taishou, my friend

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.800
You have completed your assignment magnificently

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.725
As for me... I need wait no longer

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:22.275
I will set out again

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:25.350
In search of a new purpose

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.600
Then this is farewell

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.725
Harunosuke

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:33.125
Be safe in your travels

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.283
I remember everything

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.550
Harunosuke didn't abandon me

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.925
It was I

00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:47.350
That persuaded him

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.250
And helped him escape

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.100
The labyrinth of his heart
