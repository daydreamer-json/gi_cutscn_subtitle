The Windblume Festival originated in the "Crown of the North, the City of Freedom"

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:12.675
We gotta bring enough supplies this time, otherwise you'll go hungry again!

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.473
So, if you're asking me...

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.450
On official business? We're grateful to you

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:22.822
As are we to you

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:25.700
Funny, we haven't gotten together for a meal in a while

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.257
It's been so busy lately...

00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:29.578
What should we do, on this day?

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:31.158
Mr. Albedo!

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.610
How is the research going?

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:35.369
We've had a few issues...

00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.642
Have a look at this. Now, we think...

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:41.000
Of course, any good tavern offers bar snacks

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:42.235
Really?

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.888
How should we do it? Who should we do it for?

00:00:47.953 --> 00:00:50.861
Quietly? Or boldly?

00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.273
Make the first move? Or trust to chance?

00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:59.621
Aaaah... Look out!

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.066
Sorry, so sorry!

00:01:05.778 --> 00:01:07.599
My answer is this:

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:12.449
So long as we can both share fond memories, it doesn't matter

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.825
Let the heart decide
