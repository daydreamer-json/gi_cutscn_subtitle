00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.352
A long, long time ago, in a village lost to time

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.350
There lived a crimson oni and a blue oni

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.150
They were the best of friends

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.525
The crimson oni wanted to be friends with the humans

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:16.200
So the blue oni played the role of the naughty kid...

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:20.225
And then he left

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:28.424
After a long time, the crimson oni was living happily with the humans

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.040
But in his heart, he wanted to bring the blue oni back home

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.026
The crimson oni didn't know where to find the blue oni

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.350
His search took him up the highest mountains

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:46.470
And across the widest rivers

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.925
He found many traces of the blue oni

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:55.204
But the more he found, the clearer it became:

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:58.469
The blue oni was hiding on purpose

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:06.384
So just as the blue oni had once done, the crimson oni left him a letter:

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:11.643
"Dear Ao, I've made lots of human friends now"

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:14.971
"And I wanna have a big party for everyone"

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:19.963
"I want all my friends to be there. That means you too, Ao"

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.034
"If you don't wanna meet me, you can just watch from a distance"

00:01:26.427 --> 00:01:30.743
The blue oni snuck back to the village, and hid in the shadows

00:01:30.975 --> 00:01:36.242
He saw the great feast and roaring fire, and longed to join in

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.350
But though his stomach rumbled

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.300
The blue oni remembered the oath of old, and kept his distance

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.725
Suddenly, he jumped: The crimson oni was right behind him!

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.625
"Hey, you're finally back!"

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:59.195
"C'mon, I'll introduce you!"

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:01.400
"It's time everyone met my best friend"
