00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:06.400
My story...

00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:09.098
Yes

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:10.550
I should have known

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.309
Master's failed specimen in the dragon's belly

00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:15.747
This

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.012
Is where the story truly begins

00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:24.925
If we switched places...

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:27.574
If you were the survivor...

00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:30.812
Then, as the abandoned experiment

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:33.639
The failure of the Primordial Human Project...

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.103
I'd wanna replace you too

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.027
I would replicate your appearance

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:40.906
Study your alchemy

00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:43.267
And create miraculous lifeforms

00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:45.031
To divert your attention

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:51.440
I would wait for the right moment

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:53.463
Then dispose of you and the Traveler

00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:55.862
The sole person to have known your secret

00:00:58.471 --> 00:00:59.516
And then...

00:01:00.187 --> 00:01:01.159
I could finally experience the joy

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:03.557
Of being brought into the world
