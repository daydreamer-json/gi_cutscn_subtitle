00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.824
Magic should be mysterious, surprising...

00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:08.325
And defy logic

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:10.675
Magic is hard work

00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:14.650
Every single movement has to be practiced thousands of times

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.150
It's alright. We're used to that

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:25.425
We're sorry. You've taught us so much

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.975
But we can't tell you the whole truth

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.550
It's okay. Do you still remember what I told you?

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:36.450
This world is full of lies and falsehoods

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:42.260
I only hope that one day, you can find your own truth...

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.816
What about you?

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.175
Have you found your truth?

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.425
Magic is my truth

00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:52.600
I want to perform a magic trick so great

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:54.425
That people will always think of me

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:55.833
When they talk about it

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.137
For a magician

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.400
What greater honor could there be?

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:03.641
Look!

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.275
Behold! Lyney is sealed inside the box

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.975
Will he manage to escape?

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:16.600
Ten years ago, Cesar attempted this very trick, and it was at this precise moment that...

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.300
Lyney!

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.324
Watch out!

00:01:36.253 --> 00:01:37.469
Mysterious

00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:41.629
Surprising

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.100
And logic-defying...

00:01:49.245 --> 00:01:50.375
Isn't that right?

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.493
This honor belongs to you

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:56.093
Cesar

00:02:01.277 --> 00:02:03.450
I'm just sorry it's a little late
