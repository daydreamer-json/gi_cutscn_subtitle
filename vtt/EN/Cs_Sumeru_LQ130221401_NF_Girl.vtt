WEBVTT

00:00:12.475 --> 00:00:14.000
What have you done!?

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:16.200
Calm down

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:18.550
Don't you have an easy way to figure this out?

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:27.000
You were only designated as Number 36?

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:27.950
What a shame

00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:30.750
From what I can see, your talents merit a smaller number

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:32.825
Putting aside the validity of the data

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.950
It is meaningless to judge individuals based solely on their Jnana Energy

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.075
What you said to Ilyas

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:43.500
Has now become a memory shared by all members of the Hive...

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:45.375
I see it now

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.725
You've channeled and amplified their selfish desires!

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.625
You're trying to destroy my Hive from the inside out!

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.900
Human minds are not infinitely pliable

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.200
And your Hive has stretched many of them to their limit

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.100
Once your authority as Overmind starts to wane

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:03.100
It won't be long before your subjects snap back

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:09.875
"Is it worth living here like a machine, being a tool for the rest of my life?"

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:13.420
As soon as one person begins to have these thoughts

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:19.375
Selfishness, doubt, and fear will propagate thanks to the web of consciousness that you built

00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:24.800
At this stage, your so-called Hive has already fallen

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.375
It's not over yet!

00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:31.100
I am the Overmind!

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.275
There has to be a way...

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:39.525
It's too late

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.075
Once the desires of the Hive accumulate...

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.650
Beyond a certain threshold, they will kill their king

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.075
I wouldn't have suffered such a disgraceful defeat

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.525
If I was the Overmind...

00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:55.825
My number shouldn't be so far down in the list!

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.725
Siraj is a liar!

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.275
This isn't what we agreed to...

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:02.975
I should be the one in your position!
