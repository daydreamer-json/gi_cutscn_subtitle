WEBVTT

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.671
With ropes, we can scale mountains

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.800
With boats, we can sail the seas

00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:15.875
By age 40

00:00:16.076 --> 00:00:19.338
I had conquered every last domain

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.600
Pilos Peak alone defeated me...

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.875
As an adventurer

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.680
And well, maybe in other ways too

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.559
Now, I am approaching the end of my life

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.560
Many times I have sat

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.929
And stared up at that peak

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.500
As the boundless snow slowly engulfed me

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.450
It is a beast without weakness

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.462
The merciless face of the world

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.525
It fills me with fear...

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.877
And when an adventurer loses courage

00:00:56.877 --> 00:00:59.700
They can no longer climb mountains

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.275
My mountaineering days may be over

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:06.080
But I have a greater ambition now

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.430
Humans create tools to conquer nature

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.275
And when nature conquers them in return

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:15.150
They create better tools

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.937
Where our legs cannot take us

00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:19.716
Maybe our tools can

00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:21.825
And when tools fail us

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:25.100
Perhaps wings can carry us instead

00:01:26.475 --> 00:01:29.980
My dear friend, I leave you my designs

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.584
For the "Wings of Incompletion"

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:36.727
Against the unknown, humanity stands as one

00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:37.975
To be alive

00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:43.000
Is to seek, to set foot in every place that the eye can see

00:01:44.676 --> 00:01:47.286
I have little time remaining

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.961
Though the wind has not yet come for my soul

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.275
But between us

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:58.375
And your children, students, and friends

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.100
I believe that someone will reach that place at last
