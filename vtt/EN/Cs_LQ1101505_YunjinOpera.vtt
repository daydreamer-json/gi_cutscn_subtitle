00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:09.700
(Translated) Alas!

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:20.100
Two loving souls by death cruelly parted

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:30.650
In madness and grief, a dark path started

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:40.875
Calamity was drawn, rituals subverted

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:52.575
But by her cold steel was death averted

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:03.804
Mortal ties broken, with the adepti she went

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.575
Their abiding place filling paternal bonds rent

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:13.525
To her red strings of binding they sent

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:18.650
And they dwelt long together, content

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:23.850
The crane returned to a home without luster

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:28.950
The cobwebs overgrown, the grave-shrouds a-fluster

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.350
But one bond upon her

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.988
This world could not muster

00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:41.800
Thus does the Divine Damsel's tale duly end

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.600
But today a new tale I have to append

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.227
Which I shall now tell — if you shall attend

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:54.025
From the world she seems apart

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:58.975
But there are those who know her heart

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:04.242
With crimson spear and flashing brand

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:16.585
To still the raging tides they stand

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.050
The crane once returned

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.675
And once, she was spurned

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.975
She turned, and left alone

00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:26.200
Now, she might be found

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.825
With friends all around

00:02:29.075 --> 00:02:33.075
To whom she is bound — a home
