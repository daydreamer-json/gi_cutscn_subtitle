00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.950
A magician's greatest skill

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.075
Is making things disappear

00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:06.275
Or appear

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:08.875
The possibilities are endless

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.350
But this isn't what you came for

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.225
These little tricks? You've seen them all before

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:50.650
So it's time for something truly extraordinary

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.125
Don't you think?

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:54.650
This one's a little tricky

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:05.975
Using this water tank

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:09.175
I shall make my sister vanish completely

00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:11.700
Right before your very eyes

00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:27.175
It's actually quite simple

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.800
She'll just turn into air bubbles

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.800
And float right out of the top...

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:40.250
Oh no

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.225
I told them to check all the props carefully

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.950
With the lid on

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:47.875
Even air can't escape...

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.375
An amateur magician would be getting

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:52.075
Very nervous right around now

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:53.675
Hehe

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.000
Luckily it's me on stage!

00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:59.200
So let me show you what a true virtuoso can do

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:13.575
Lynette

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:14.875
Are you still there?

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.900
Don't go too far

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:19.400
We don't wanna use up all our magic

00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:20.425
Hi

00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:21.800
I'm back
